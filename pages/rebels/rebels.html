                        <em>The Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter, also known
                            simply as the ARC-170 starfighter, was a heavy-duty model
                            of starfighter used by the Galactic Republic during the
                            Clone Wars and was considered the latest in fighter
                            technology. Jointly manufactured by Incom Corporation
                            and Subpro, it would continue to see usage into the
                            reign of the Galactic Empire, but would eventually be
                            phased out by the newer TIE line. </em>
